# Green Bonds

This is a series of graphs to support the green bonds analysis. The original file is `First_green_bond_plottying.ipynb`, a jupyter notebook file.

The file has been extrapolated into a single python script file to generate the plotted graphs.

## Setup

First install the required modules from within the cloned directory.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can run the `generate_greenbond_graphs.py` file with the below command(s) from your shell prompt:

`python3 generate_greenbond_graphs.py`

or if running from linux and you have python3 already installed,

`./generate_greenbond_graphs.py`

This should run the script file and launch them into your local web browser.

__NOTE__: This repo is a work in progress, and will be improved by iteration.

TODO: 
 -- include FRANCE_BOND_SERIES.xlsx for additional graphs and analysis
